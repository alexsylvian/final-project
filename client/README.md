## The Projector

The Projector is an app for projects, to be used by large organizations or even just for your home and family. Register, and create any number of projects and subtasks. Assign memebers of your organization to these tasks. Any member can assign any other member to any subtask, as long as they're logged in. Use this app to make your organization more efficient.

## Installation

To use, clone the github package and cd into the server, and run 'python app.py' in the terminal. Then create another terminal and cd into the client and run 'npm start'. Make sure you already have Python installed on your device!

## Usage

To use the projector, simply run the app, and you'll be greeted by your projects. Search through them to your content (completed projects will be marked as such), or scroll to the bottom and create a new project. You can enter any of the projects to see more details, and create new subtasks. Assign any users (you can see a detailed user list on the navbar) to the subtask and give the priority you want that user to tackle the project with. Mark the subtasks complete when they're finished.
